Description: For a single, known pathogen phylogeny, provides functions for enumeration of the set of compatible epidemic transmission trees, and for uniform sampling from that set. Optional arguments allow for incomplete sampling with a known number of missing individuals, multiple sampling, and known infection time limits. Always assumed are a complete transmission bottleneck and no superinfection or reinfection. See Hall and Colijn <doi:10.1101/160812> for methodology.
